# Monitoring as Code Hands-on Training
This repository contains hands-on exercises for Monitoring as Code - aka Monaco.
It has been built by the Dynatrace ACE Innovation team. Reach out on aceservices@dynatrace.com for feedback.

## Prerequisites
1. Download the monaco executable. Check the section below for more info
2. Download this repository locally - either via `git clone` or using the GitHub download capability
3. A Dynatrace environment. Preferable this is an empty environment that is not used for other purposes
4. The exercises will often go to the command line. The example commands are based on linux and might need some changes for other operating systems
5. An advanced text editor (e.g. Sublime, NotePad++) or IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code) are recommended

## Installing Monaco on your machine
1. Download the executable for your target architecture and operating system from https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-monitoring-as-code/releases 
2. Depending on your OS, you need to make it executable (e.g. using `chmod +x monaco`)
3. Optionally, add the exectuable to your PATH - depending on your OS (Linux/mac: e.g. `cp monaco /usr/local/bin`)

## Starting the exercises
In order to get started, open the **exercises** folder. It is best to view the exercises in GitHub, as each folder has a markdown file with proper formating
